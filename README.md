# JavaScript to TypeScript Example

This repository demonstrates how to gradually introduce TypeScript type annotations into a JavaScript project without changing the file extensions. The code will remain in `.js` format while simulating TypeScript-like type annotations.

## Branches:
- **main**: Stable version of the code.
- **develop**: Active development branch.
